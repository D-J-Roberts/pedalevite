        MapSaturate.h
        Author: Laurent de Soras, 2016

Maps a positive number in [0 ; X scale] into a number in [0 ; Y scale].

saturate() gives a "saturated" curve:
	y = (1+c) - (1+c)*c / (x + c)
	y'(0) = (1+c) / c

desaturate() gives a kind of exponential curve:
	x = -c - (1+c)*c / (y - (1+c))
	x'(0) = c / (1+c)
	x'(1+c-sqrt((1+c)*c)) = 1

Mapping is done in order to realize:
- x == desaturate (saturate (x))
- x == saturate (desaturate (x))

Computation is very fast (1 div, 2 add).

T: Numeric type for all operations, must be floating point.
C: std::ratio, curve, must be > 0. The smaller, the steeper is the curve
XS: X scale, std::ratio
YS: Y scale, std::ratio
