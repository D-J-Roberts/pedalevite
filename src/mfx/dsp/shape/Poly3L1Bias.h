        Author: Laurent de Soras, 2016

Output is soft-clipped between -1.0 and 1.0.
For bias = 0, output > input for positive values and output < input for
negative values. Thus, applying the formula recursively on any input excepted
0 leads to -1 or +1.
Function is continuous up to its first derivate.

Template parameters:

- BIAS: std::ratio for the bias, in [-1 ; 1]
