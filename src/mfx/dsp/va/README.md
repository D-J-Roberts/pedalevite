## va — virtual analogue circuit simulations

These classes are audio processors modelled from electronic circuits

- **`DiodeClipDAngelo`**: Simple passive antiparallel diode clipper.
- **`DiodeClipScreamer`**: Diode clipper in the feedback path of an operational amplifier with non-inverting input. Modelled from the Tube Screamer gain stage.
