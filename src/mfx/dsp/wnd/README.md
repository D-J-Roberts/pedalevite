## wnd â€” windowing functions and similar shapes

- **`WndInterface`**: A generic interface to build a window of a given length.
- **`Generic`**: a class implenting `WndInterface` and taking a functor to get the window formula.
- **`XFadeShape`**: a simple raised cosine shape, convenient to perform crossfades.

The other classes are functors for various window functions.
